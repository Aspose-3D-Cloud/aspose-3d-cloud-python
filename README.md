# Ruby SDK for 3D File Formats

[Aspose.3D Cloud SDK for Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/3d/python) empowers your PHP applications to connect with 3D document formats. The APIs let engineers read, convert, build, alter and control the substance of the [3D document formats](https://docs.aspose.cloud/3d/supported-document-formats/) in the Cloud. All without any 3D modeling and rendering software installed on the machine.

## Process 3D Objects & Files in the Cloud

- [Create 3D entities](https://docs.aspose.cloud/3d/create-a-new-entity-with-size/) - Box, Sphere, Plane, Torus, Cylinder.
- Perform processing of 3D models and attributes.
- Perform transformation, translation, rotation & scaling of 3D objects.
- [Convert 3D files](https://docs.aspose.cloud/3d/converting-between-formats-using-aspose-3d-cloud/) to other format.
- Convert whole of the 3D file or convert a specific part only.
- [Extract 3D scenes](https://docs.aspose.cloud/3d/extract-and-save-a-scene-in-a-different-format/) and export to various formats.
- Perform parametric modeling, 3D modeling & data processing.
- Create cloud-based folder structure & perform cloud-based conversion of 3D files.
- [Extract 3D raw data from PDF](https://docs.aspose.cloud/3d/extract-raw-data-from-a-pdf-file/). Password-protected 3D PDF files are supported as well.
- Supports working with triangulate meshes, triangulate whole or part of the 3D scene.
- [Remove 3D objects from a scene](https://docs.aspose.cloud/3d/delete-nodes-from-a-scene/).
